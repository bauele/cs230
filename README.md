## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client had a Draw It or Lose It game available on their website. They wanted assistance making their game available on additional platforms, such as Android and iOS. 

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did particularly well explaining the pros and cons between each operating system.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I felt that it was very helpful to lay out all the goals that I was seeking to accomplish within the document. Even more so, it was especially helpful to mention what features were out of scope of the project. 

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I would revise the table containing the operating systems and their various pros and cons. I felt pressured to make the information as concise as possible to preserve the formatting, but I feel that by doing so I had to cut out a lot of potentially useful information. Given the chance, I would remove the table format and instead focus on breaking down the relevant categories into small paragraphs. 

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted their needs as requiring two new front ends for Android and iOS respectively that made use of their existing backend api for their current website. It is important to always consider the user's actual needs when designing software so that time and money is not wasted on something they simply do not want or need. 

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach was to clearly define what was in scope for the project as well as what was not in scope. In doing so, I was able to set clear expectations for both myself and the client. I would use this strategy again in the future. Additionally,  I would hope to be able to devote more time to gathering usage requirements to better reflect their needs in my design document.
